# Hello!

I'm a theoretical neuroscientist interested in how neuronal networks process information and learn in different temporal and spatial scales.

## Codes

Here you will find codes I used in my latest papers papers:

Everton J Agnes, Andrea I Luppi, and Tim P Vogels, Journal of Neuroscience JN-RM-0276-20; https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0276-20.2020

From Basile Confavreux: https://github.com/basile6/MetaLearnBiologicallyPlausibleRules for A meta-learning approach to (re)discover plasticity rules that carve a desired function into a neural network (2020).
